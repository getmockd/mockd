## Why mockd?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Zero Dependencies" icon="rocket">
    Single binary written in Go. No runtime dependencies, no configuration servers, no Docker required for basic usage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Instant Setup" icon="star">
    Define mocks in JSON and start serving immediately. Your first mock API runs in under 5 minutes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stateful Mocking" icon="document">
    Simulate real CRUD APIs with persistent state. Create, update, delete resources and see changes reflected across requests.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Proxy Recording" icon="magnifier">
    Record real API traffic through the MITM proxy and replay responses as mocks. Perfect for capturing production behavior.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible Matching" icon="setting">
    Match requests by path, method, headers, query params, and body content. Use exact matches or regex patterns.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Developer First" icon="laptop">
    Works offline, runs locally, integrates with any HTTP client. Use for development, testing, or CI/CD pipelines.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Your First Mock

Create a file called `mocks.json`:

```json
{
  "mocks": [
    {
      "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "path": "/api/users"
      },
      "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "headers": {
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        "body": {
          "users": [
            {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"},
            {"id": 2, "name": "Bob"}
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Start the server:

```bash
mockd start --config mocks.json
```

Test it:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4280/api/users
```

## Use Cases

### Development

Mock external APIs during frontend development. No need to wait for backend teams or deal with rate limits.

### Testing

Create predictable test fixtures for integration and end-to-end tests. Control every response.

### CI/CD

Run fast, isolated tests in CI pipelines without external dependencies.

### Prototyping

Quickly prototype API designs before implementing the real backend.
