# Admin-only configuration for 3-container split E2E tests.
#
# This config starts ONLY the Admin API (control plane) on port 4290.
# No engine is started here — engines register remotely via HTTP.
#
# Architecture:
#   admin container  -> Admin API (:4290)
#   engine container -> Engine (:4280) + Control API (:4281) -> registers with admin
#   test-runner      -> CLI + curl against both
